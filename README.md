# JavaLibrary
Some simple Java solutions to some of the common problems.

## 1. Travelling Sales Man Problem
Given a list of cities and the distances between them, find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the starting city.

## 2. Sudoku Solver
Given a partially filled 9×9 2D array, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits in such a way that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 sub-grids that compose the grid all contain all the digits from 1 to 9.

## 3. Knapsack Problem
Given weights and values of n items, put these items in a knapsack of capacity W to get the maximum total value in the knapsack.

## 4. N-Queens Problem
The N Queen is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

## 5. Graph Algorithms
Implement graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path, and Kruskal's or Prim's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree.

## 6. Concurrent Programming
Develop a program that simulates a scenario where multiple threads or processes are working concurrently and need to synchronize their actions to avoid conflicts.

## 7. Compiler or Interpreter
Design a simple programming language and create a compiler or interpreter for it. This involves parsing, semantic analysis, and generating executable code.

## 8. Blockchain Simulator
Create a simplified simulation of a blockchain network. Implement the basic functionalities of blockchain, such as adding transactions, validating blocks, and achieving consensus.

## 9. Image Processing
Develop algorithms for tasks like image filtering, edge detection, image segmentation, and other image processing operations.

## 10. Machine Learning Algorithms
Implement machine learning algorithms from scratch, such as linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, or neural networks.

## 11. Operating System Scheduler
Create a simple simulation of an operating system scheduler that manages the execution of processes using various scheduling algorithms like Round Robin, Priority Scheduling, etc.

## 12. Cryptography Algorithms
Implement cryptographic algorithms like RSA, AES, or Diffie-Hellman key exchange to demonstrate secure communication and encryption techniques.
